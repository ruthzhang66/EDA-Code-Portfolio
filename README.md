# EDA-Code-Portfolio
# Harrisburg University of Science and Technology - Chenlu Zhang
# This code portfolio contains weekly coding practice for ANLY 506-51 class, most codes are from YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R by Nathaniel D. Phillips and some are from Exploratory Data Analysis by Roger D. Peng.
# 
# Each week's practice has one or two files named under the week number, depending on how many coding pratices are required. R markdowns and R files are saved under the first folder, while the output of html, pdf and png are saved under the second folder. Please note that I only include the pdf and png that are saved under my working directory when running codes. Other pictures that are not saved in the directory are not included.

# Week 2 practice involves Chapter 9 Importing, saving and managing data.
# Week 3's topic is Exploratory Data Analysis Checklist.
# Week 4 has two parts of coding practice, one is about Matrices and Dataframes and another is about Vectors
# In week 5, relevant codes for tidy data are included in the r file and the tidy-practice.rmd file can also be found in the folder with my notes.
# Week 6's topic is data transformation.
# Week 7's topic is data visulisation, which is about the usage of ggplot and different aes.
# For week 9, random sampling codes are attached.
# Week 10 discusses Cluster Analysis.
# Week 11 is about Principal Component Analysis.
# Week 12 is about Model Diagnostics, along with a case using mtcars and autompg as datasets.
